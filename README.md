[Getting Started with Roxy](https://fergdev.github.io/roxy/)

## Testing

Run with

```bash
cargo run -- --port 6969 --script scripts/logger.lua
```

Or with debug logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=0 cargo run -- --port 6969 --script scripts/logger.lua
```

```bash

### HTTP

```bash
curl -v --proxy http://localhost:6969 http://example.com
```

Tests require single thread to prevent too many open files error.

```bash
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test
```

### HTTPS

```bash
export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=~/.roxy/roxy-ca-cert.pem
curl -v --proxy http://localhost:6969 https://example.com --insecure
```

## Goals

This is a learning project to explore building a fast, flexible proxy with scriptable interception and inspection capabilities. The goal is to create a tool that can be used for debugging, testing, and learning about network protocols.

Ideal goals is feature parity with existing tools like mitmproxy, but with a focus on performance, flexibility and style.

I love MITM proxy, but do not enjoy the CLI. I am aiming to improve on the CLI experience while maintaining the powerful features that make it great.

## Contributing
